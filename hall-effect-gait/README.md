Real-time gait cadence estimation using Hall-effect magnetic sensing and embedded signal processing.
This project implements stride detection, cadence smoothing, and FFT-based frequency analysis to extract clinically meaningful gait metrics from raw physiological sensor data.
Designed as part of a biomedical signal processing pipeline for wearable and rehabilitation-focused sensing systems.
