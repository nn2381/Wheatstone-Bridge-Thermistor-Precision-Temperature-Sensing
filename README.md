# Medical-Device-Signal-Processing

Collection of embedded biomedical signal-processing projects developed for medical device applications, including PPG heart-rate/SpO₂ analysis, FFT and autocorrelation methods, gait detection with Hall-effect sensors, precision temperature sensing, and closed-loop glucose–insulin PID simulation. Each project demonstrates real-time physiological data acquisition, filtering, feature extraction, and control-system implementation using Arduino-based hardware and MATLAB-informed modeling approaches.
